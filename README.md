#CSU, Northridge Defense
The main purpose of this organization is to provide experience and exposure to CSU Northridge students who are interested in working for the Aerospace and Defense industry. 

## What Are We Trying to Achieve?
Our goal for this organization is to create senior design based research within four sectors of Defense: Air, Maritime, Ground, and Space forces. 
Within the four sectors, CSUN Defense hopes to design and build autonamous drones and robots to provide defensive mechanisms from potential threat. 

## Our First Project:
### Summer 2022 / MataDrone
